        Hi, my name is Aleks.
        \n\nI love fitness
        \n\nThe kind that is alive and wims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
        \n\nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
        \n\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
        \n\nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
        \n\nAnd even less sometimes, I actualli catch something.
        \n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
        \n\nI´ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
        \nYou should aks someone else about fishing, though.\n\n
